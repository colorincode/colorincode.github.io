## Peer Reviews

### Step by Step Process
        
1. **Fork peer's code from github** (or send manually if necessary)
2. **Check naming conventions first**. Does the naming of variables follow common sense logic? Does CSS follow a BEM standard? Does the variable or class name state intent (either in comments or in the name itself?) 
Examples of statement of intent can include:<br/>
<code>"main--slider--wrapper" or "$vansredbtn" ...e.g. anything that gives the reviewer an idea of what it does
</code>
 **See resources below to check BEM, OOCSS standards.
3. 

### - The main checklist

- **Explain why the code exists:**  Explain why the code exists. ("It's like that because of these reasons. Would it be more clear if I rename this class/file/method/variable?")
- **K.I.S.S**  Is this code as simple as it can be? Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem, if any.
- **Lexer Data:**  What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things usin

### - Research / Justification
### - Goals and Anti Goals

- **Main Goals**  
        [1] To break good code, and make it better.
        [2] Be grateful for the reviewer's suggestions. ("Good call. I'll make that change.")
        [3] Don't take it personally. The review is of the code, not you.
        [4] Don't be a know it all smarty pants. We are all smart, offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. 
        [5] Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs,preferences, reach a resolution quickly.
        [6] Avoid using terms that are personal or insulting. ("dumb", "stupid").
