# vans devs hub

This is intended to be a non judgmental, collaborative tool to help us all code better, learn from mistakes, learn from others, and an overall resources for devs / design to work together to make more happen. This may also help the team identify strengths and weaknesses within so we can improve our workflow.

**Goals**
While no exact goals have been set, it might be a good idea to set measurable goals:
Have 100% of team reviewing code.
Have all code meeting 60-80% of (internal) code standards.


## Peer Reviews

### Step by Step Process
        
1. **Fork peer's code from github** (or send manually if necessary) - pull requests / commits / branches are a good idea here - but we probably need a system for those. 
2. **Check naming conventions first**. Does the naming of variables follow common sense logic? Does CSS follow a BEM standard? Does the variable or class name state intent (either in comments or in the name itself?) 
Examples of statement of intent can include:<br/>
<code>"main--slider--wrapper"</code><br/>
<code>or "$vansredbtn"</code> <br/>
<code><!--this is the main wrapper main--slider--wrapper--> </code><br/>
<code> /* this (function, class, mixin) does x */</code><br/>
 **See "resources" below to check BEM, OOCSS standards.**
 Follow up: Does the code actually do what the statement of intent declares? 

3. **Follow this main checklist** to go through the code. Good tips: Try not to read through more than 500 lines of code per hour, and try to make sure that you thoroughly review the code. A good code review typically takes at least 1 hour. 

4. For any page inspection, **try to think of different "scenarios"** this code would be useful, or not useful. (From the perspective of a customer that has never used this page, is the design usable? Is it intuitive? Can it be learned quickly?... From the perspective of a shareholder or your boss, does this code drive/encourage the customer to point of sale?)

### - The main checklist

- **Explain why the code exists:**  Explain why the code exists. ("It's like that because of these reasons. Would it be more clear if I rename this class/file/method/variable?")
- **K.I.S.S**  Is this code as simple as it can be? Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem, if any.
- **Lexer Data:**  What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things usin

### - Research / Justification
### - Goals and Anti Goals

- **Main Goals**  
1. To break good code, and make it better.
2. Be grateful for the reviewer's suggestions. ("Good call. I'll make that change.")
3. Avoid innuendo, personal attacks, brutality in review. The code is under a microscope, not the dev. 
4. Don't be a know it all smarty pants. We are all smart, offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. 
5. Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs,preferences, reach a resolution quickly. Just because this isn't how you would have done it, does NOT mean that it is incorrect.
